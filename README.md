# Simple-Timer

Well, just...

    const timer = new Timer()
    
And then simply...

    console.log("Execution at MILLISECOND: " + timer.time())

And if you want to reset the timer, you can also:

    timer.reset()

Ah! The first added (or last reseted) date is accessible at:

    timer.first

That's all the API.
