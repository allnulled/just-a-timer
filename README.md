# Simple-Timer

Well, just...

    const timer = new Timer();
    
And then simply...

    console.log("Execution at: " + timer.time());

And if you want to reset the timer, you can also:

    timer.reset();

Ah! The first added (or last reseted) date is accessible at:

    timer.time();

That's all the API.
